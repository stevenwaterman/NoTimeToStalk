# Content Warnings

In your playthrough of No Time To Stalk, you will encounter content that you may find sensitive.
Due to the dynamic nature of the game, you will not see everything on this page during your playthrough.
Additionally, AI generated text may include references to things not listed here, though we do our best to manually check and remove anything abusive, discriminatory, or otherwise concerning.
For this reason we can't promise that this list is exhaustative.
See the `AI Generated Text` section below for more detail on how to limit the risk of offending AI generated text.

**We think this game would be given a 12 or 15 (T for teen) rating**, mostly due to innuendo, sexual, and drug references.

This list details all of the topics that you may want to know about before playing.
It makes the game look far worse than it is, but that's because we've made the list detailed, including anything that is briefly touched on.

Click on any topic for a description of the offending content with minimal spoilers.
Where explaining the content in detail would involve spoilers, you can click again for a full description with spoilers.
